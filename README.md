# 📊 Data Preprocessing for Life Expectancy Analysis 🌍

Welcome to the **Data Preprocessing** repository! This project focuses on cleaning and transforming a dataset related to **Life Expectancy** across various countries to make it ready for analysis and machine learning. 🏥📈

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is **`Life Expectancy Data v2.csv`**, containing **health, economic, and demographic** indicators for multiple countries over different years. 🌎✨  

### 🔹 **Key Features in the Dataset**:
- **📍 Country & Year** – Name of the country & year of observation.
- **🛠️ Status** – Country type (**Developed / Developing**).
- **📆 Life Expectancy** – Average lifespan in years.
- **⚰️ Adult & Infant Mortality** – Death rates per 1000 people.
- **🥂 Alcohol Consumption** – Per capita alcohol intake (liters).
- **💉 Immunization Rates** – Coverage for **Polio, Diphtheria, Hepatitis B**.
- **💰 GDP & Economic Factors** – Gross Domestic Product per capita, schooling years.
- **📊 Health Indicators** – BMI, HIV/AIDS-related mortality, malnutrition rates.

📌 *The dataset includes a mix of numerical & categorical variables that need thorough preprocessing!* 🏗️🔍

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

The data preprocessing includes the following key steps to **ensure high-quality data** for analysis! 🚀

1️⃣ **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Imputation (Mean/Median) or removal of incomplete records.  
   - Dealing with missing categorical values using **mode** or **backward fill**.

2️⃣ **Encoding Categorical Variables**  
   - Transforming `Status` (Developed/Developing) into **binary (0/1) values**.  

3️⃣ **Feature Scaling & Normalization**  
   - Standardization or Min-Max Scaling of numerical values for **better ML model performance**. 📈

4️⃣ **Outlier Detection & Handling**  
   - Using **box plots** and `IQR method` to detect extreme values. 📊  
   - Applying `Winsorization` or **log transformation** to reduce skewness.

5️⃣ **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating **new insights** from existing data (e.g., **Health Index Score**).  

🛠️ These steps ensure **data consistency, accuracy, and efficiency** for predictive modeling. 💡✅
